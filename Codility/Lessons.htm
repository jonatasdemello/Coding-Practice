<h1>Lesson 1</h1>
<h2>Iterations</h2>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/binary_gap/">BinaryGap</a></h3>
<p>Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>binary gap</i>&nbsp;within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.</p>
<p>For example, number 9 has binary representation&nbsp;1001&nbsp;and contains a binary gap of length 2.</p>
<p>The number 529 has binary representation&nbsp;1000010001&nbsp;and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.</p>
<p>The number 20 has binary representation&nbsp;10100&nbsp;and contains one binary gap of length 1.</p>
<p>The number 15 has binary representation&nbsp;1111&nbsp;and has no binary gaps.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int N); }</p>
<p>that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of <b>its longest</b> binary gap.</p>
<p>The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.</p>
<p>For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation&nbsp;10000010001&nbsp;and so its longest binary gap is of length 5.</p>
<p>Given N = 32 the function should return 0, because N has binary representation '100000' and thus no binary gaps.</p>
<p>Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].</p>
<p>Complexity:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N));</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/odd_occurrences_in_array/">OddOccurrencesInArray</a></h3>
<p>Find value that occurs in odd number of elements.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The array contains an odd number of elements, and each element of the array can be paired with another element that has the same value, except for one element that is left unpaired.</p>
<p>For example, in array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 9 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 9 A[3] = 3 A[4] = 9 A[5] = 7 A[6] = 9</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the elements at indexes 0 and 2 have value 9,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the elements at indexes 1 and 3 have value 3,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the elements at indexes 4 and 6 have value 9,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the element at index 5 has value 7 and is unpaired.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given an array A consisting of N integers fulfilling the above conditions, returns the value of the unpaired element.</p>
<p>For example, given array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 9 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 9 A[3] = 3 A[4] = 9 A[5] = 7 A[6] = 9</p>
<p>the function should return 7, as explained in the example above.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an odd integer within the range [1..1,000,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; all but one of the values in A occur an even number of times.</p>
<p>Complexity:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case space complexity is O(1), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).</p>
<p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/">CyclicRotation</a></h3>
<p>Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.</p>
<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.</p>
<p>For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]. The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right by K indexes.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }</p>
<p>that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.</p>
<p>For example, given array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] and K = 3, the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8].</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N and K are integers within the range [0..100];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of array A is an integer within the range [&#8722;1,000..1,000].</p>
<p>In your solution, focus on&nbsp;correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.</p>

<h2>Time Complexity</h2>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/perm_missing_elem/">PermMissingElem</a></h3>
<p>Find the missing element in a given permutation.</p>
<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.</p>
<p>Your goal is to find that missing element.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns the value of the missing element.</p>
<p>For example, given array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 2 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1 A[3] = 5</p>
<p>the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the elements of A are all distinct;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].</p>
<p>Complexity:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</p>

<p>Elements of input arrays can be modified.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/frog_jmp/">FrogJmp</a></h3>
<p>Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y.</p>
<p>A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.</p>
<p>Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }</p>
<p>that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.</p>
<p>For example, given:</p>
<p>X = 10 Y = 85 D = 30</p>
<p>the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; X &#8804; Y.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/3-time_complexity/tape_equilibrium/">TapeEquilibrium</a></h3>
<p>Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Array A represents numbers on a tape.</p>
<p>Any integer P, such that 0 &lt; P &lt; N, splits this tape into two non-empty parts: A[0], A[1], ..., A[P &#8722; 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N &#8722; 1].</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>difference</i>&nbsp;between the two parts is the value of: |(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P &#8722; 1]) &#8722; (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N &#8722; 1])|</p>
<p>In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.</p>
<p>For example, consider array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 3 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 2 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 3</p>
<p>We can split this tape in four places:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; P = 1, difference = |3 &#8722; 10| = 7</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; P = 2, difference = |4 &#8722; 9| = 5</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; P = 3, difference = |6 &#8722; 7| = 1</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; P = 4, difference = |10 &#8722; 3| = 7</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.</p>
<p>For example, given:</p>

<h2>Counting Elements</h2>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/4-counting_elements/perm_check/">PermCheck</a></h3>
<p>Check whether array A is a permutation.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>permutation</i>&nbsp;is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.</p>
<p>For example, array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 4 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 2</p>
<p>is a permutation, but array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 4 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 3</p>
<p>is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.</p>
<p>The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.</p>
<p>For example, given array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 4 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 2</p>
<p>the function should return 1.</p>
<p>Given array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 4 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 3</p>
<p>the function should return 0.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>

<p>Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river.</p>
<p>&nbsp;small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get to the opposite bank (position X+1). Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.</p>
<p>You are given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers representing the falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time K, measured in seconds.</p>
<p>The goal is to find the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river. The frog can cross only when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X (that is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from 1 to X are covered by leaves). You may assume that the speed of the current in the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their positions once they fall in the river.</p>
<p>For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 3 A[6] = 5 A[7] = 4</p>
<p>In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position across the river.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int X, int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.</p>
<p>If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the function should return &#8722;1.</p>
<p>For example, given X = 5 and array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 1 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 3 A[6] = 5 A[7] = 4</p>
<p>the function should return 6, as explained above.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N and X are integers within the range [1..100,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..X].</p>

<p>that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.</p>
<p>For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.</p>
<p>For another example, given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.</p>
<p>Given A = [&#8722;1, &#8722;3], the function should return 1.</p>

<p>Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum.</p>
<p>You are given N counters, initially set to 0, and you have two possible operations on them:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; <i>increase(X)</i>&nbsp;&#8722; counter X is increased by 1,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; <i>max counter</i>&nbsp;&#8722; all counters are set to the maximum value of any counter.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A of M integers is given. This array represents consecutive operations:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; if A[K] = X, such that 1 &#8804; X &#8804; N, then operation K is increase(X),</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; if A[K] = N + 1 then operation K is max counter.</p>
<p>For example, given integer N = 5 and array A such that:</p>

<p>that, given an integer N and a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of M integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the values of the counters.</p>
<p>The sequence should be returned as:</p>

<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; a vector of integers (in C++), or</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; a record Results (in Pascal), or</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; an array of integers (in any other programming language).</p>
<p>For example, given:</p>

<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.</p>
<p>Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; 0 represents a car traveling east,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; 1 represents a car traveling west.</p>
<p>The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where 0 &#8804; P &lt; Q &lt; N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to the west.</p>
<p>For example, consider array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 0 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1</p>
<p>We have five pairs of passing cars: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4).</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the number of pairs of passing cars.</p>
<p>The function should return &#8722;1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.</p>
<p>For example, given:</p>
<p>A[0] = 0 A[1] = 1 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1</p>
<p>the function should return 5, as explained above.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of array A is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/genomic_range_query/">GenomicRangeQuery</a></h3>
<p>Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA.</p>
<p>A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters&nbsp;A,&nbsp;C,&nbsp;G&nbsp;and&nbsp;T, which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence. Each nucleotide has an&nbsp;<i>impact factor</i>, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types&nbsp;A,&nbsp;C,&nbsp;G&nbsp;and&nbsp;T&nbsp;have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?</p>
<p>The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S =&nbsp;S[0]S[1]...S[N-1]&nbsp;consisting of N characters. There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and Q, each consisting of M integers. The K-th query (0 &#8804; K &lt; M) requires you to find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).</p>
<p>For example, consider string S =&nbsp;CAGCCTA&nbsp;and arrays P, Q such that:</p>
<p>P[0] = 2 Q[0] = 4 P[1] = 5 Q[1] = 5 P[2] = 0 Q[2] = 6</p>
<p>The answers to these M = 3 queries are as follows:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; The part of the DNA between positions 2 and 4 contains nucleotides&nbsp;G&nbsp;and&nbsp;C&nbsp;(twice), whose impact factors are 3 and 2 respectively, so the answer is 2.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; The part between positions 5 and 5 contains a single nucleotide&nbsp;T, whose impact factor is 4, so the answer is 4.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; The part between positions 0 and 6 (the whole string) contains all nucleotides, in particular nucleotide&nbsp;A&nbsp;whose impact factor is 1, so the answer is 1.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int[] solution(string S, int[] P, int[] Q); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed string S consisting of N characters and two non-empty zero-indexed arrays P and Q consisting of M integers, returns an array consisting of M integers specifying the consecutive answers to all queries.</p>
<p>The sequence should be returned as:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; a Results structure (in C), or</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; a vector of integers (in C++), or</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; a Results record (in Pascal), or</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; an array of integers (in any other programming language).</p>
<p>For example, given the string S =&nbsp;CAGCCTA&nbsp;and arrays P, Q such that:</p>
<p>P[0] = 2 Q[0] = 4 P[1] = 5 Q[1] = 5 P[2] = 0 Q[2] = 6</p>
<p>the function should return the values [2, 4, 1], as explained above.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];</p>

<p>Find the minimal average of any slice containing at least two elements.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A pair of integers (P, Q), such that 0 &#8804; P &lt; Q &lt; N, is called a&nbsp;<i>slice</i>&nbsp;of array A (notice that the slice contains at least two elements). The&nbsp;<i>average</i>&nbsp;of a slice (P, Q) is the sum of A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q] divided by the length of the slice. To be precise, the average equals (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[Q]) / (Q &#8722; P + 1).</p>
<p>For example, array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 4 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 2 A[3] = 5 A[4] = 1 A[5] = 5 A[6] = 8</p>

<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the starting position of the slice with the minimal average. If there is more than one slice with a minimal average, you should return the smallest starting position of such a slice.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/7-stacks_and_queues/fish/">Fish</a></h3>
<p>N voracious fish are moving along a river. Calculate how many fish are alive.</p>
<p>You are given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers. Arrays A and B represent N voracious fish in a river, ordered downstream along the flow of the river.</p>
<p>The fish are numbered from 0 to N &#8722; 1. If P and Q are two fish and P &lt; Q, then fish P is initially upstream of fish Q. Initially, each fish has a unique position.</p>
<p>Fish number P is represented by A[P] and B[P]. Array A contains the sizes of the fish. All its elements are unique. Array B contains the directions of the fish. It contains only 0s and/or 1s, where:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; 0 represents a fish flowing upstream,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; 1 represents a fish flowing downstream.</p>
<p>If two fish move in opposite directions and there are no other (living) fish between them, they will eventually meet each other. Then only one fish can stay alive &#8722; the larger fish eats the smaller one. More precisely, we say that two fish P and Q meet each other when P &lt; Q, B[P] = 1 and B[Q] = 0, and there are no living fish between them. After they meet:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; If A[P] &gt; A[Q] then P eats Q, and P will still be flowing downstream,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; If A[Q] &gt; A[P] then Q eats P, and Q will still be flowing upstream.</p>
<p>We assume that all the fish are flowing at the same speed. That is, fish moving in the same direction never meet. The goal is to calculate the number of fish that will stay alive.</p>
<p>For example, consider arrays A and B such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 4 B[0] = 0 A[1] = 3 B[1] = 1 A[2] = 2 B[2] = 0 A[3] = 1 B[3] = 0 A[4] = 5 B[4] = 0</p>
<p>Initially all the fish are alive and all except fish number 1 are moving upstream. Fish number 1 meets fish number 2 and eats it, then it meets fish number 3 and eats it too. Finally, it meets fish number 4 and is eaten by it. The remaining two fish, number 0 and 4, never meet and therefore stay alive.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int[] B); }</p>
<p>that, given two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the number of fish that will stay alive.</p>

<p>Find the index S such that the leaders of the sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N - 1] are the same.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>leader</i>&nbsp;of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.</p>

<p>we can find two equi leaders:</p>

<p>The goal is to find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals N. The sides of this rectangle should be only integers.</p>
<p>For example, given integer N = 30, rectangles of area 30 are:</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/peaks/">Peaks</a></h3>
<p>Divide an array into the maximum number of same-sized blocks, each of which should contain an index P such that A[P - 1] &lt; A[P] &gt; A[P + 1].</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>peak</i>&nbsp;is an array element which is larger than its neighbors. More precisely, it is an index P such that 0 &lt; P &lt; N &#8722; 1,&nbsp; A[P &#8722; 1] &lt; A[P] and A[P] &gt; A[P + 1].</p>
<p>For example, the following array A:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 3 A[5] = 4 A[6] = 1 A[7] = 2 A[8] = 3 A[9] = 4 A[10] = 6 A[11] = 2</p>
<p>has exactly three peaks: 3, 5, 10.</p>
<p>We want to divide this array into blocks containing the same number of elements. More precisely, we want to choose a number K that will yield the following blocks:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; A[0], A[1], ..., A[K &#8722; 1],</p>

<p>What's more, every block should contain at least one peak. Notice that extreme elements of the blocks (for example A[K &#8722; 1] or A[K]) can also be peaks, but only if they have both neighbors (including one in an adjacent blocks).</p>
<p>The goal is to find the maximum number of blocks into which the array A can be divided.</p>
<p>Array A can be divided into blocks as follows:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; one block (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2). This block contains three peaks.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; two blocks (1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4) and (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2). Every block has a peak.</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; three blocks (1, 2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 1, 2), (3, 4, 6, 2). Every block has a peak. Notice in particular that the first block (1, 2, 3, 4) has a peak at A[3], because A[2] &lt; A[3] &gt; A[4], even though A[4] is in the adjacent block.</p>
<p>However, array A cannot be divided into four blocks, (1, 2, 3), (4, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3) and (4, 6, 2), because the (1, 2, 3) blocks do not contain a peak. Notice in particular that the (4, 3, 4) block contains two peaks: A[3] and A[5].</p>
<p>The maximum number of blocks that array A can be divided into is three.</p>

<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum number of blocks into which A can be divided.</p>
<p>If A cannot be divided into some number of blocks, the function should return 0.</p>
<p>For example, given:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 3 A[5] = 4 A[6] = 1 A[7] = 2 A[8] = 3 A[9] = 4 A[10] = 6 A[11] = 2</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/flags/">Flags</a></h3>
<p>Find the maximum number of flags that can be set on mountain peaks.</p>
<p>A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>peak</i>&nbsp;is an array element which is larger than its neighbours. More precisely, it is an index P such that 0 &lt; P &lt; N &#8722; 1 and A[P &#8722; 1] &lt; A[P] &gt; A[P + 1].</p>
<p>For example, the following array A:</p>

<p>has exactly four peaks: elements 1, 3, 5 and 10.</p>
<p>You are going on a trip to a range of mountains whose relative heights are represented by array A, as shown in a figure below. You have to choose how many flags you should take with you. The goal is to set the maximum number of flags on the peaks, according to certain rules.</p>

<p>Flags can only be set on peaks. What's more, if you take K flags, then the distance between any two flags should be greater than or equal to K. The distance between indices P and Q is the absolute value |P &#8722; Q|.</p>
<p>For example, given the mountain range represented by array A, above, with N = 12, if you take:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; two flags, you can set them on peaks 1 and 5;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; three flags, you can set them on peaks 1, 5 and 10;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; four flags, you can set only three flags, on peaks 1, 5 and 10.</p>
<p>You can therefore set a maximum of three flags in this case.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the maximum number of flags that can be set on the peaks of the array.</p>
<p>For example, the following array A:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 5 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 3 A[5] = 4 A[6] = 1 A[7] = 2 A[8] = 3 A[9] = 4 A[10] = 6 A[11] = 2</p>
<p>the function should return 3, as explained above.</p>

<p>Two positive integers N and M are given. Integer N represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from 0 to N &#8722; 1.</p>
<p>You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.</p>

<p>F(0) = 0 F(1) = 1 F(M) = F(M - 1) + F(M - 2) if M &gt;= 2</p>
<p>A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located at one bank of the river (position &#8722;1) and wants to get to the other bank (position N). The frog can jump over any distance F(K), where F(K) is the K-th Fibonacci number. Luckily, there are many leaves on the river, and the frog can jump between the leaves, but only in the direction of the bank at position N.</p>
<p>The leaves on the river are represented in a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers. Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive positions from 0 to N &#8722; 1 on the river. Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; 0 represents a position without a leaf;</p>

<p>Two segments I and J, such that I &#8800; J, are&nbsp;<i>overlapping</i>&nbsp;if they share at least one common point. In other words, A[I] &#8804; A[J] &#8804; B[I] or A[J] &#8804; A[I] &#8804; B[J].</p>
<p>We say that the set of segments is&nbsp;<i>non-overlapping</i>&nbsp;if it contains no two overlapping segments. The goal is to find the size of a non-overlapping set containing the maximal number of segments.</p>

<p>In a given array, find the subset of maximal sum in which the distance between consecutive elements is at most 6.</p>
<p>A game for one player is played on a board consisting of N consecutive squares, numbered from 0 to N &#8722; 1. There is a number written on each square. A non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers contains the numbers written on the squares. Moreover, some squares can be marked during the game.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, there is a pebble on square number 0 and this is the only square on the board which is marked. The goal of the game is to move the pebble to square number N &#8722; 1.</p>
<p>During each turn we throw a six-sided die, with numbers from 1 to 6 on its faces, and consider the number K, which shows on the upper face after the die comes to rest. Then we move the pebble standing on square number I to square number I + K, providing that square number I + K exists. If square number I + K does not exist, we throw the die again until we obtain a valid move. Finally, we mark square number I + K.</p>
<p>After the game finishes (when the pebble is standing on square number N &#8722; 1), we calculate the result. The result of the game is the sum of the numbers written on all marked squares.</p>
<p>For example, given the following array:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = -2 A[2] = 0 A[3] = 9 A[4] = -1 A[5] = -2</p>
<p>one possible game could be as follows:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the pebble is on square number 0, which is marked;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; we throw 3; the pebble moves from square number 0 to square number 3; we mark square number 3;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; we throw 5; the pebble does not move, since there is no square number 8 on the board;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; we throw 2; the pebble moves to square number 5; we mark this square and the game ends.</p>
<p>The marked squares are 0, 3 and 5, so the result of the game is 1 + 9 + (&#8722;2) = 8. This is the maximal possible result that can be achieved on this board.</p>

<p>Given a string containing words, find the longest word that satisfies specific conditions.</p>
<p>You would like to set a password for a bank account. However, there are three restrictions on the format of the password:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; it has to contain only alphanumerical characters (a&#8722;z,&nbsp;A&#8722;Z,&nbsp;0&#8722;9);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; there should be an even number of letters;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; there should be an odd number of digits.</p>
<p>You are given a string S consisting of N characters. String S can be divided into&nbsp;<i>words</i>&nbsp;by splitting it at, and removing, the spaces. The goal is to choose the longest word that is a valid password. You can assume that if there are K spaces in string S then there are exactly K + 1 words.</p>
<p>For example, given &quot;test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1&quot;, there are five words and three of them are valid passwords: &quot;5&quot;, &quot;a0A&quot; and &quot;pass007&quot;. Thus the longest password is &quot;pass007&quot; and its length is 7. Note that neither &quot;test&quot; nor &quot;?xy1&quot; is a valid password, because &quot;?&quot; is not an alphanumerical character and &quot;test&quot; contains an even number of digits (zero).</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(string S); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of the longest word from the string that is a valid password. If there is no such word, your function should return &#8722;1.</p>
<p>For example, given S = &quot;test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1&quot;, your function should return 7, as explained above.</p>

<p>Find the maximum depth of water in mountains after a huge rainfall.</p>
<p>You are helping a geologist friend investigate an area with mountain lakes. A recent heavy rainfall has flooded these lakes and their water levels have reached the highest possible point. Your friend is interested to know the maximum depth in the deepest part of these lakes.</p>
<p>We simplify the problem in 2-D dimensions. The whole landscape can be divided into small blocks and described by an array A of length N. Each element of A is the altitude of the rock floor of a block (i.e. the height of this block when there is no water at all). After the rainfall, all the low-lying areas (i.e. blocks that have higher blocks on both sides) are holding as much water as possible. You would like to know the maximum depth of water after this entire area is flooded. You can assume that the altitude outside this area is zero and the outside area can accommodate infinite amount of water.</p>
<p>For example, consider array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 3 A[2] = 2 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 2 A[5] = 1 A[6] = 5 A[7] = 3 A[8] = 3 A[9] = 4 A[10] = 2</p>

<p>The gray area is the rock floor described by the array A above and the blue area with dashed lines represents the water filling the low-lying areas with maximum possible volume. Thus, blocks 3 and 5 have a water depth of 2 while blocks 2, 4, 7 and 8 have a water depth of 1. Therefore, the maximum water depth of this area is 2.</p>

<p>Given a sequence, find the longest subsequence that can be decomposed into at most three monotonic parts.</p>
<p>You are a skier participating in a giant slalom. The slalom track is located on a ski slope, goes downhill and is fenced by barriers on both sides. The barriers are perpendicular to the starting line located at the top of the slope. There are N slalom gates on the track. Each gate is placed at a distinct distance from the starting line and from the barrier on the right-hand side (looking downhill).</p>
<p>You start from any place on the starting line, ski down the track passing as many gates as possible, and finish the slalom at the bottom of the slope.&nbsp;<i>Passing</i>&nbsp;a gate means skiing through the position of the gate.</p>
<p>You can ski downhill in either of two directions: to the left or to the right. When you ski to the left, you pass gates of increasing distances from the right barrier, and when you ski to the right, you pass gates of decreasing distances from the right barrier. You want to ski to the left at the beginning.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, changing direction (left to right or vice versa) is exhausting, so you have decided to change direction&nbsp;<i>at most two</i>&nbsp;times during your ride. Because of this, you have allowed yourself to miss some of the gates on the way down the slope. You would like to know the maximum number of gates that you can pass with at most two changes of direction.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the gates is given as an array A consisting of N integers, whose elements specify the positions of the gates: gate K (for 0 &#8804; K &lt; N) is at a distance of K+1 from the starting line, and at a distance of A[K] from the right barrier.</p>
<p>For example, consider array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0] = 15 A[1] = 13 A[2] = 5 A[3] = 7 A[4] = 4 A[5] = 10 A[6] = 12 A[7] = 8 A[8] = 2 A[9] = 11 A[10] = 6 A[11] = 9 A[12] = 3</p>

<p>The picture above illustrates the example track with N = 13 gates and a course that passes eight gates. After starting, you ski to the left (from your own perspective). You pass gates 2, 3, 5, 6 and then change direction to the right. After that you pass gates 7, 8 and then change direction to the left. Finally, you pass gates 10, 11 and finish the slalom. There is no possible way of passing more gates using at most two changes of direction.</p>

<p>Count the distinct rectangle sizes, of area greater than or equal to X, that can be built out of a given set of segments.</p>
<p>Halfling Woolly Proudhoof is an eminent sheep herder. He wants to build a pen (enclosure) for his new flock of sheep. The pen will be rectangular and built from exactly four pieces of fence (so, the pieces of fence forming the opposite sides of the pen must be of equal length). Woolly can choose these pieces out of N pieces of fence that are stored in his barn. To hold the entire flock, the area of the pen must be greater than or equal to a given threshold X.</p>
<p>Woolly is interested in the number of different ways in which he can build a pen. Pens are considered different if the sets of lengths of their sides are different. For example, a pen of size 14 is different from a pen of size 22 (although both have an area of 4), but pens of sizes 12 and 21 are considered the same.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A, int X); }</p>
<p>that, given a zero-indexed array A of N integers (containing the lengths of the available pieces of fence) and an integer X, returns the number of different ways of building a rectangular pen satisfying the above conditions. The function should return &#8722;1 if the result exceeds 1,000,000,000.</p>
<p>For example, given X = 5 and the following array A:</p>
<p>A[0] = 1 A[1] = 2 A[2] = 5 A[3] = 1 A[4] = 1 A[5] = 2 A[6] = 3 A[7] = 5 A[8] = 1</p>

<p>the function should return 2. The figure above shows available pieces of fence (on the left) and possible to build pens (on the right). The pens are of sizes 1x5 and 2x5. Pens of sizes 11 and 12 can be built, but are too small in area. It is not possible to build pens of sizes 23 or 35, as there is only one piece of fence of length 3.</p>

<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; X is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000];</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/91-tasks_from_indeed_prime_2016_challenge/dwarfs_rafting/">DwarfsRafting</a></h3>
<p>Find out how many dwarfs can fit on a raft such that it's balanced when crossing a river.</p>
<p>A company of dwarfs is travelling across the New Zealand. On reaching the Clutha River the dwarfs need to get across, but recent storms have washed away the bridge. Luckily, a small ferry, in the form of a square raft, is operating.</p>
<p>The raft is square and has N rows of seats, numbered from 1 to N. Each row contains N seats, labeled with consecutive letters (A,&nbsp;B,&nbsp;C, etc.). Each seat is identified by a string composed of its row number followed by its column number; for example, &quot;9C&quot; denotes the third seat in the 9th row.</p>
<p>The raft has already been loaded with barrels in some seat positions, and other seats are already occupied by dwarfs. Our company of dwarfs may only take the remaining unoccupied seats. The ferryman wants to accommodate as many dwarfs as possible, but the raft needs to be stable when making the crossing. That is, the following conditions must be satisfied:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the front and back halves of the raft (in terms of the rows of seats) must each contain the same number of dwarfs;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; similarly, the left and right sides of the raft (in terms of the columns of seats) must each contain the same number of dwarfs.</p>
<p>You do not have to worry about balancing the barrels; you can assume that their weights are negligible.</p>
<p>For example, a raft of size N = 4 is shown in the following illustration:</p>
<p><img width=208 height=179 src="Lessons_files/image009.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/dwarfs_rafting/static/images/auto/566482207f88b47c87c6163876cc1b2f.png"></p>
<p>Barrels are marked as brown squares, and seats that are already occupied by dwarfs are labeled&nbsp;d.</p>
<p>The positions of the barrels are given in string S. The occupied seat numbers are given in string T. The contents of the strings are separated by single spaces and may appear in any order. For example, in the diagram above, S = &quot;1B 1C 4B 1D 2A&quot; and T = &quot;3B 2D&quot;.</p>
<p>In this example, the ferryman can accommodate at most six more dwarfs, as indicated by the green squares in the following diagram:</p>
<p><img width=208 height=179 src="Lessons_files/image010.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/dwarfs_rafting/static/images/auto/31eaf5c0da7d6267c0f4175a8b23b6aa.png"></p>
<p>The raft is then balanced: both left and right halves have the same number of dwarfs (four), and both front and back halves have the same number of dwarfs (also four).</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int N, string S, string T); }</p>
<p>that, given the size of the raft N and two strings S, T that describes the positions of barrels and occupied seats, respectively, returns the maximum number of dwarfs that can fit on the raft. If it is not possible to balance the raft with dwarfs, your function should return&nbsp;-1.</p>
<p>For instance, given N = 4, S = &quot;1B 1C 4B 1D 2A&quot; and T = &quot;3B 2D&quot;, your function should return 6, as explained above.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an even integer within the range [2..26];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; strings S, T consist of valid seat numbers, separated with spaces;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each seat number can appear no more than once in the strings;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; no seat number can appear in both S and T simultaneously.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/91-tasks_from_indeed_prime_2016_challenge/tree_product/">TreeProduct</a></h3>
<p>Remove at most two edges from a tree graph to maximize the product of the components' sizes.</p>
<p>Elves in the forest of Glandishar are preparing for an Orc invasion. They have a network of N + 1 guard posts located on the open platforms in the treetops. The posts are numbered from 0 to N and are connected by N bridges, so that one can get from any one guard post to any other guard post in a unique way. In other words, guard posts and bridges form a tree graph.</p>
<p>The Elves are afraid that if the Orcs manage to get hold of one of the guard posts, then they will have easy access to all the other guard posts. Therefore, the Elves have decided to destroy at most two bridges and split the guard posts into at most three separate areas, so that the guards can move within each area but it's not possible to move between the areas.</p>
<p>In each area there will be one guard who will move from guard post to guard post during the night. If the Orcs attack, the guards will raise an alarm. However, if the Orcs manage to guess the guard post in which the guards are currently located, they may manage to take out the guards without raising the alarm. The Elves want to avoid the situation that all guard posts fail this way, by maximizing:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; X * Y * Z, if the guard posts have been divided into three areas consisting of X, Y and Z guard posts, respectively;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; X * Y, if the guard posts have been divided into two areas consisting of X and Y posts, respectively;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N + 1, if the guard posts haven't been divided;</p>
<p>depending on which option gives the largest result.</p>
<p>You are given a map of the network in the form of two arrays A, B of length N. For each K (0 &#8804; K &lt; N) there is a bridge between posts A[K] and B[K].</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public string solution(int[] A, int[] B); }</p>
<p>that, given two zero-indexed arrays A and B of N integers, returns the largest possible result. Since the result can be large, you should return it as a string.</p>
<p>For example, given the following arrays:</p>
<p>A[0] = 0 B[0] = 1 A[1] = 1 B[1] = 2 A[2] = 1 B[2] = 3 A[3] = 3 B[3] = 4 A[4] = 3 B[4] = 5 A[5] = 6 B[5] = 3 A[6] = 7 B[6] = 5</p>

<p>the function should return &quot;18&quot; since the Elves can destroy bridges 1&#8722;3 and 3&#8722;5 (marked as dashed lines in the image above). The created areas consist of 3, 3 and 2 guard posts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the result is 3 * 3 * 2 = 18. It is not possible to obtain a better result.</p>
<p>Given the following arrays:</p>
<p>A[0] = 0 B[0] = 1 A[1] = 1 B[1] = 2</p>
<p>the function should return &quot;3&quot; (it is optimal not to destroy any bridge).</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [0..N];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; distance from guard post 0 to any other post is not greater than 900 bridges.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/91-tasks_from_indeed_prime_2016_challenge/hilbert_maze/">HilbertMaze</a></h3>
<p>Find the shortest path between two fields in a Hilbert maze.</p>
<p>A halfling is searching for treasure hidden in a maze in the dwarfs' mine. He has a map of the maze and would like to find the shortest path to the treasure.</p>
<p>The maze has a specific shape. It is placed on a square grid with M<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;cells, where M = 2<sup>N+1</sup>+1 for some given size N. Each cell has coordinates (x, y), where 0 &#8804; x, y &lt; M, and can either be empty or contain a rock.</p>
<p>The mazes of sizes N = 1 and N = 2 are presented in the pictures below:</p>
<p><img width=410 height=204 src="Lessons_files/image012.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/hilbert_maze/static/images/auto/e5540ee69f2da8c4972a22eb7ad7dbb9.png"></p>
<p>A maze of size N is constructed recursively from the layout of the maze of size N&#8722;1 (like the Hilbert curve). It contains four mazes of size N&#8722;1, each maze in one quarter. The maze in the bottom-left quarter is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise and the maze in the bottom-right quarter is rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The mazes in the top quarters are not rotated. There are three additional rocks (squares marked in green in the picture below) in the areas where the mazes intersect. The construction of the maze of size N = 3 is shown below:</p>

<p>The halfling would like to reach the treasure in the smallest number of steps possible. At each step, he can move to any one of the four adjacent cells (north, south, west, east) that does not contain a rock and is not outside of the grid.</p>
<p>For example, given N = 1, the halfling needs 8 steps to move from cell (2, 1) to cell (3, 4):</p>

<p>Bob is about to go on a trip. But first he needs to take care of his supply of socks. Each sock has its own color. Bob wants to take as many pairs of clean socks as possible (both socks in the pair should be of the same color).</p>
<p>Socks are divided into two drawers: clean and dirty socks. Bob has time for only one laundry and his washing machine can clean at most K socks. He wants to pick socks for laundering in such a way that after washing he will have a maximal number of clean, same-colored pairs of socks. It is possible that some socks cannot be paired with any other sock, because Bob may have lost some socks over the years.</p>
<p>Bob has exactly N clean and M dirty socks, which are described in arrays C and D, respectively. The colors of the socks are represented as integers (equal numbers representing identical colors).</p>
<p>For example, given four clean socks and five dirty socks:</p>

<p>Recover a broken array using partial information in another array.</p>
<p>Bob once had an array A with N elements. Each element was a positive integer not exceeding M.</p>
<p>Bob wrote a program to find an array B, defined as follows. For every index J, let's find the biggest index K such that K &lt; J and A[K] &lt; A[J]. Then set B[J] = A[K]. If there is no such index K, then set B[J] = 0. Intuitively, the J-th element of B contains the last value smaller than A[J] that appears before it, or 0 if there is no such element.</p>
<p>For example, let A = [2, 5, 3, 7, 9, 6]. Then B = [0, 2, 2, 3, 7, 3]. For instance, B[5] = 3, as A[5] is 6 and the last value before A[5] smaller than 6 is 3.</p>
<p>Bob computed an array B and then mistakenly deleted A. He now intends to find every valid array A from which his program would produce B. Count the number of such arrays A. Since the answer could be very big, return it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] B, int M); }</p>
<p>that, given an integer M and a zero-indexed array B with N integers, returns the remainder from the division by 10<sup>9</sup>+7 of the number of valid arrays A from which Bob would get B. You can assume that there is at least one such array.</p>
<p>For example, given: M = 4, B = [0, 2, 2] the function should return 3. The possible removed arrays A were [2, 3, 3], [2, 4, 3] and [2, 4, 4].</p>
<p>For the following data: M = 10, B = [0, 3, 5, 6] the function should return 4, as the possible arrays A were [3, 5, 6, 7], [3, 5, 6, 8], [3, 5, 6, 9] and [3, 5, 6, 10].</p>
<p>For the following data: M = 10<sup>5</sup>, B = [0, 0] there are 5000050000 possible arrays (the first element in array A can be anything in the range 1..10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and the second element can be either equal or smaller), so the function should return 49965 (as we are taking modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7).</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>

<p>Find a symmetry point of a string, if any.</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(string S); }</p>
<p>that, given a string S, returns the index (counting from 0) of a character such that the part of the string to the left of that character is a reversal of the part of the string to its right. The function should return &#8722;1 if no such index exists.</p>

<p>Note: reversing an empty string (i.e. a string whose length is zero) gives an empty string.</p>
<p>For example, given a string:</p>
<p>&quot;racecar&quot;</p>
<p>the function should return 3, because the substring to the left of the character &quot;e&quot; at index 3 is &quot;rac&quot;, and the one to the right is &quot;car&quot;.</p>
<p>Given a string:</p>
<p>&quot;x&quot;</p>
<p>the function should return 0, because both substrings are empty.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/99-future_training/tree_height/">TreeHeight</a></h3>
<p>Compute the height of a binary tree.</p>
<p>In this problem we consider binary trees, represented by pointer data structures.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>binary tree</i>&nbsp;is either an empty tree or a node (called the&nbsp;<i>root</i>) consisting of a single integer value and two further binary trees, called the&nbsp;<i>left subtree</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>right subtree</i>.</p>
<p>For example, the figure below shows a binary tree consisting of six nodes. Its root contains the value 5, and the roots of its left and right subtrees have the values 3 and 10, respectively. The right subtree of the node containing the value 10, as well as the left and right subtrees of the nodes containing the values 20, 21 and 1, are empty trees.</p>
<p><img width=152 height=188 src="Lessons_files/image020.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/tree_height/static/images/auto/f6ee45e3a63ec4fade2ed27c6bab8e54.png"></p>
<p>A&nbsp;<i>path</i>&nbsp;in a binary tree is a non-empty sequence of nodes that one can traverse by following the pointers. The&nbsp;<i>length</i>&nbsp;of a path is the number of pointers it traverses. More formally, a path of length K is a sequence of nodes P[0], P[1], ..., P[K], such that node P[I + 1] is the root of the left or right subtree of P[I], for 0 &#8804; I &lt; K. For example, the sequence of nodes with values 5, 3, 21 is a path of length 2 in the tree from the above figure. The sequence of nodes with values 10, 1 is a path of length 1. The sequence of nodes with values 21, 3, 20 is not a valid path.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>height</i>&nbsp;of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest possible path in the tree. In particular, a tree consisting of only one node has height 0 and, conventionally, an empty tree has height &#8722;1. For example, the tree shown in the above figure is of height 2.</p>
<p>Problem</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p><code>class Solution { public int solution(Tree T); }</code></p>
<p>that, given a non-empty binary tree T consisting of N nodes, returns its height. For example, given tree T shown in the figure above, the function should return 2, as explained above. Note that the values contained in the nodes are not relevant in this task.</p>
<p>Technical details</p>
<p>A binary tree can be given using a pointer data structure. Assume that the following declarations are given:</p>
<p><code>class Tree { public int x; public Tree l; public Tree r; };</code></p>
<p>An empty tree is represented by an empty pointer (denoted by&nbsp;<code>null</code>). A non-empty tree is represented by a pointer to an object representing its root. The attribute&nbsp;<code>x</code>&nbsp;holds the integer contained in the root, whereas attributes&nbsp;<code>l</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>r</code>&nbsp;hold the left and right subtrees of the binary tree, respectively.</p>
<p>For the purpose of entering your own test cases, you can denote a tree recursively in the following way. An empty binary tree is denoted by&nbsp;<code>None</code>. A non-empty tree is denoted as (X, L, R), where X is the value contained in the root and L and R denote the left and right subtrees, respectively. The tree from the above figure can be denoted as:</p>
<p><code>(5, (3, (20, None, None), (21, None, None)), (10, (1, None, None), None))</code></p>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [1..1,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the height of tree T (number of edges on the longest path from root to leaf) is within the range [0..500].</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/99-future_training/array_inversion_count/">ArrayInversionCount</a></h3>
<p>Compute number of inversion in an array.</p>
<p>A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. An&nbsp;<i>inversion</i>&nbsp;is a pair of indexes (P, Q) such that P &lt; Q and A[Q] &lt; A[P].</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</p>
<p>that computes the number of inversions in A, or returns &#8722;1 if it exceeds 1,000,000,000.</p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; each element of array A is an integer within the range [&#8722;2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].</p>
<p>For example, in the following array:</p>
<p>A[0] = -1 A[1] = 6 A[2] = 3 A[3] = 4 A[4] = 7 A[5] = 4</p>
<p>there are four inversions:</p>
<p>(1,2) (1,3) (1,5) (4,5)</p>
<p>so the function should return 4.</p>

<h3><a href="https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/99-future_training/polygon_concavity_index/">PolygonConcavityIndex</a></h3>
<p>Check whether a given polygon in a 2D plane is convex; if not, return the index of a vertex that doesn't belong to the convex hull.</p>
<p>An array A of points in a 2D plane is given. These points represent a polygon: every two consecutive points describe an edge of the polygon, and there is an edge connecting the last point and the first point in the array.</p>
<p>A set of points in a 2D plane, whose boundary is a straight line, is called a&nbsp;<i>semiplane</i>. More precisely, any set of the form {(x, y) : ax + by &#8805; c} is a semiplane. The semiplane contains its boundary.</p>
<p>A polygon is&nbsp;<i>convex</i>&nbsp;if and only if, no line segment between two points on the boundary ever goes outside the polygon.</p>
<p>For example, the polygon consisting of vertices whose Cartesian coordinates are consecutively:</p>
<p>(-1, 3) (3, 1) (0, -1) (-2, 1)</p>
<p>is convex.</p>
<p><img width=460 height=398 src="Lessons_files/image021.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/polygon_concavity_index/static/images/auto/3d80c5f9b98a66ef667cbb5fb77d1a7e.png"></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>convex hull</i>&nbsp;of a finite set of points in a 2D plane is the smallest convex polygon that contains all points in this set. For example, the convex hull of a set consisting of seven points whose Cartesian coordinates are:</p>
<p>(-1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (1, 1) (0, -1) (-2, 1) (-1, 2)</p>
<p>is a polygon that has five vertices. When traversed clockwise, its vertices are:</p>
<p>(-1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (0, -1) (-2, 1)</p>
<p><img width=460 height=398 src="Lessons_files/image022.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/polygon_concavity_index/static/images/auto/4eaef4a123926fef3c7f2d77529fce1f.png"></p>
<p>If a polygon is concave (that is, it is not convex), it has a vertex which does not lie on its convex hull border. Your assignment is to find such a vertex.</p>
<p>Assume that the following declarations are given:</p>
<p>class Point2D { public int x; public int y; };</p>
<p>Write a function:</p>
<p>class Solution { public int solution(Point2D[] A); }</p>
<p>that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N elements describing a polygon, returns &#8722;1 if the polygon is convex. Otherwise, the function should return the index of any point that doesn't belong to the convex hull border. Note that consecutive edges of the polygon may be collinear (that is, the polygon might have 180&#8722;degrees angles).</p>
<p>To access the coordinates of the K-th point (where 0 &#8804; K &lt; N), use the following syntax:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; A[K].x&nbsp;to access the x-coordinate,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; A[K].y&nbsp;to access the y-coordinate.</p>
<p>For example, given array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0].x = -1 A[0].y = 3 A[1].x = 1 A[1].y = 2 A[2].x = 3 A[2].y = 1 A[3].x = 0 A[3].y = -1 A[4].x = -2 A[4].y = 1</p>
<p>the function should return &#8722;1, as explained in the example above.</p>
<p>However, given array A such that:</p>
<p>A[0].x = -1 A[0].y = 3 A[1].x = 1 A[1].y = 2 A[2].x = 1 A[2].y = 1 A[3].x = 3 A[3].y = 1 A[4].x = 0 A[4].y = -1 A[5].x = -2 A[5].y = 1 A[6].x = -1 A[6].y = 2</p>
<p>the function should return either 2 or 6. These are the indices of the polygon lying strictly in its convex hull (that is, not on the convex hull border).</p>
<p><img width=460 height=398 src="Lessons_files/image023.png" alt="https://codility-frontend-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/task_static/polygon_concavity_index/static/images/auto/db0266cc912d437defa8a5718bb0921a.png"></p>
<p>Assume that:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; N is an integer within the range [3..10,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; the coordinates of each point in array A are integers within the range [&#8722;1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000];</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; no two edges of the polygon A intersect, other than meeting at their endpoints;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; array A does not contain duplicate points.</p>
<p>Complexity:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &diams; &nbsp; expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).</p>
