First you must install NodeJS.
Open the command prompt to run following commands.
Windows 7: Open Start and write cmd into the search and press enter.
Windows XP: Open Start and select Run and write cmd and press enter.

Run this command to install a HTTP server: 
	npm install http-server -g

And start the HTTP server: 
	http-server /path/to/docroot 

with a path to the folder you want to share. 
Your folder must have some files before it works.
Now just open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.


If you have Node.Js setup then you can use http-server. 

Just run: 
	npm install http-server -g 
and you will be able to use it in terminal like 
	http-server C:\location\to\app.


Go to your app directory
Start SimpleHTTPServer

In the terminal

$ cd yourAngularApp
~/yourAngularApp $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Now, go to localhost:8000 in your browser and the page will show

When you're running npm install in the project's root, it installs all of the npm dependencies into the project's node_modules directory.

If you take a look at the project's node_modules directory, you should see a directory called http-server, which holds the http-server package, and a .bin folder, which holds the executable binaries from the installed dependencies. The .bin directory should have the http-server binary (or a link to it).

So in your case, you should be able to start the http-server by running the following from your project's root directory (instead of npm start):

./node_modules/.bin/http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1
This should have the same effect as running npm start.

If you're running a Bash shell, you can simplify this by adding the ./node_modules/.bin folder to your $PATH environment variable:

export PATH=./node_modules/.bin:$PATH
This will put this folder on your path, and you should be able to simply run

http-server -a localhost -p 8000 -c-1
